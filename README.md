# Super Simple Markdown Viewer

This is a super simple markdown file php viewer

I almost exclusively write proposals, reports etc in [ Markdown ](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

However I find that I am usually better off sharing these documents as HTML webpages

I wanted a quick and easy system that would allow me to write in Markdown and then present to people in HTML

Hopefully this is it..

(This also gave me an excuse to get more familiar with Composer)

To use, just clone to your webserver, then pop your Markdown formated text into the source.md file located in src/mymd/model/

P.S. I am using [PHP Markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown?source=c) to parse the Markdown text
